Always open "home.html" to understand the website

API list is given in an other txt file.

Because we are using free API they tend to be a bit unreliable frequently..so we have a few list of API provided.
If the API fails to fetch the data you will get a message in your terminal as,
	Error fetching data: Error: Network response was not ok
    	at file:///D:/BADLA/News%20Aggregator/script.js:58:19 {stack: 'Error: Network response was not ok
    	at filâ€¦///D:/BADLA/News%20Aggregator/script.js:58:19', message: 'Network response was not ok'}

If need can be changed and u can add your API link and URL as per your wish in the scrip file("script.js")

Watch the "Demo_Video" to get an idea about the project.
